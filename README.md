## General info
This project is using kaggle dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adorigueto/cnc-turning-roughness-forces-and-tool-wear) to create a classification model. The model is used to assign a label that depends on the flank wear of the knife in a cnc lathe. Further explanation and comments can be found inside the LatheKnifeWearClassification notebook.
